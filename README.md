# EMS AngulaRest

UseCase: - An Employee Management System is designed to simplify the process of record maintenance of employees in an organisation. It helps in managing the information of employees for HR functions. In general, EMS is a part of a comprehensive Human Resource Management System. Most modern companies use computers to collect this information, making their system more accurate and problem-free. A database is often used to collect the information required.

Employee Management System as a Modern Web Application using Angular 7 and consuming RESTful APIs. I have used Visual Studio Code 1.34.0 as an IDE.

Complex level of a Angular Web Application integrated with RESTful APIs to connect to backend database.

For all beginners/semi-pro, this is perfect repository to start-off with an angular web application describing Employee Management System consuming RESTful APIs. 

## NOTE

Once you run the application, you would be able to see the UI pages for Creating, Updating, Searching and Deleting Employees but it won't show any Employee data. You still need to deploy the EMS REST API Service which is being consumed by this application. I have already uploaded EMS REST API Service as an individual repository https://github.com/darkerror96/semi-ems_rest_api. Clone or Download the repository from given link and deploy it in any Java IDE. Once deployed, refresh the EMS Angular Web Application to see the magic.

## Development server

Open Terminal and Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. One can also Run `ng serve --open` and app will automatically be deployed in your default browser.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
